# Productivity App
 This Productivity App motivates you to keep coding at least an hour a day. Once you have completed the full hour, you´ll hear a loud applause from a cheering crowd, because you did it again! Well done you! 
 
 ### Who is this for? 
 
 Use it to complete your #100daysofcode challenge, or any other challenge really! You can enter your own topic, and swith from dark to light mode. 
 
 ### What else can I do with this? 
 I´ve left some comments where I would like to continue developing, like animating the timer, collect the form data, or throw in confetti to go with the applause. Feel free to play around and give it your own touch. My main focus was to practise and understand the logic of Javascript. 
 
 ### Credits
 Applause sound from Zapsplat.com.
